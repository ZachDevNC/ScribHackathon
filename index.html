                Welcome to scrib a beautiful up and coming new web application for helping you to achieve all of your creative two-dimensional needs. Here at scrib we beleive that constaints breed creativity so we began to think "How can we help people be more creative?", which lead us to our answer of giving you, our budding artists, hardly any options at all. We've all been there, staring at large blank white screen, eyes darting across multitudes of tools, filters, and clickables that we have no idea what they do. Fear begins to set in and the application gets closed out. Here with scrib we remedy that with a clean and modern drawing platform that let's you do just what you want, draw.

            <p class="words1">Tired of having a tool bar with way too many options leaving you feeling overwhelmed with "analysis paralysis"? Well our web app helps breed your creativity by giving you the thing you want most, limitation! With our sleek color wheel partnered by a couple adjustment sliders, you can choose your color and get to drawing.<br><br><br>
            When your done with you image, or frustated and want to quit looking at the moster you've created we have added a quick drawing reset button to wip your abomination from the earth as well as a quick color reset to start your ideas fresh!

        <div class="row2">
            <p class="words2">No more "white void" fear when starting a new drawing, our canvas features a grey toned background to give you the push you need to go ahead and lay down some lines within our large drawing area.<br><br>
            Fear of commitment affects 87.3% of todays population and we wanted to address that concern with a theraputic tool within our app called "the lack of an eraser". This is Franklin, a duck I drew in scrib. Franklin sucks as a drawing but thrives as an act of commitment to make sure every line was purposeful and adored. Come commit with us!</p>
